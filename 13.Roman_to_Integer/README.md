Learning Summary:
 - Used a for loop to iterate one by one through the string of roman numerals using 2 pointers (1 at the current index and the second at the current index + 1);
 - Used an object to store the values of each roman numeral and accessed it using bracket notation like an array and combined it with the current input.
 - Initiated a result variable to 0 and updated it with an if statement for each iteration of the input string of roman numerals.
 - Used the if statement to subtract and add the roman numerals based on if the current roman numeral was less than or equal to/greater the next one in the string.

Problem description:
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000

For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: III = 3.

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 15
s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].
